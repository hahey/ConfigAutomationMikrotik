# example: how to extract an id by picking first 5 numbers of macaddress
# one cannot use this to define the identity because of special letters
:local macaddr [/interface ethernet get [/interface ethernet find default-name=ether1] mac-address];

# example: how to remove the dhcp client by finding the number for the specific interface
:if ([/ip dhcp-client find interface=ether1] != "") do={
    /ip dhcp-client remove [/interface dhcp-client find interface=ether1]
}

# example: similar example as above for ip address
:if ([/ip address find interface=ether1] != "") do={

# example: this example does't work as it is intended because the numbering
# changes as the each bridge port is kicked out
:foreach i in [/interface bridge port find] do={
    :if ([:pick [/interface bridge port get $i interface] 0 5] == "wlan") do={
        /interface bridge port remove $i

# example: this also does not work for the same reason
:foreach i in [/ip dhcp-client find] do={
    /ip dhcp-client remove $i
};
